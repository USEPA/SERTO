The Stormwater Emergency Response Tool & Optimizer (SERTO) is a python package that provides a set of tools
around the EPA SWMM model for optimizing infrastructure sizing and placement, operations, and for emergency
response applications in stormwater systems. The official SERTO software repository is in the U.S. EPA's
GitHub repository (https://github.com/USEPA/serto). Releases are also made available via PyPI and conda-forge.
